# Amplify Infrastructure Management Platform

The repository provides an AWS Amplify infrastructure management solution centrally.

The repository defines Amplify related infrastructure using Terraform, and modulized the resources for different senarios and use cases in `modules` directory.

In `settings` directory, each Amplify app has dedicated settings. Based on the settings, a dedicated GitHub workflow is trigged to provision the responsonding AWS infrastructure to the cloud.

## Getting Started

Step 1. Create a new folder for new project under `settings` directory using the nickname of project.

> Notes: The nickname of project is a short name with lowercase letters only that separated with `-`. For example `my-new-app`.

```bash
cp -r settings/amplify-vue-app settings/my-new-app
```

Step 2. Modify `settings/my-new-app/tfvars.json`.

| Field         | Type        | Value Example                                      | Description                                |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| nickname      | string      | amplify-vue-app                                    | Nickname of project                        |
| app_name      | string      | Host Vue based web application in AWS Amplify      | Description of project                     |
| repository    | string      | <https://github.com/camillehe1992/amplify-vue-app> | Repository of frontend source code locates |
| branch_config | map(object) | -                                                  | Branch configuration for each environment  |

**branch_config** Environment

> Note: You can have more environments (int, test, uat, staging, etc) for your project. An Amplify app is created for each environment with environment prefixed.

| Environment | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| dev         | The branch configuration for development environment |
| prod        | The branch configuration for production environment  |

**branch_config** Environment Branch Config

| Environment Branch Config   | Type        | Value   | Description                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| enabled                     | boolean     | true    | Enable the environment deployment             |
| environment                 | string      | dev     | The environment short name                    |
| branch_name                 | string      | develop | The source code branch for the environment    |
| enable_auto_build           | boolean     | true    | Enables auto building for the branch          |
| enable_pull_request_preview | boolean     | true    | Enables pull request previews for this branch |
| environment_variables       | map(object) | {}      | Environment variables for the branch          |

**tfvars.json** Examples:

```json
{
  "nickname": "amplify-vue-app",
  "app_name": "Host Vue based web application in AWS Amplify",
  "repository": "https://github.com/camillehe1992/amplify-vue-app",
  "branch_config": {
    "dev": {
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": "dev",
      "branch_name": "develop",
      "enable_auto_build": true,
      "enable_pull_request_preview": true,
      "environment_variables": {
        "VUE_BASE_API_URL": "https://amplify-vue-app-dev.example.com/api",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
      }
    },
    "prod": {
      "enabled": false,
      "environment": "prod",
      "branch_name": "main",
      "enable_auto_build": true,
      "enable_pull_request_preview": true,
      "environment_variables": {
        "environment_variables": {
          "VUE_BASE_API_URL": "https://amplify-vue-app.example.com/api",
          "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Step 4. Create GitHub Actions workflow.

```bash
cp .github/workflow/template.yaml .github/workflow/my-new-app.yaml
```

Update the `<NICKNAME>` in the workflow yaml file with the nickname you provide in `tfvars.json`.

Step 5. Deploy AWS infrastructure

After settings is completed, you can verify the deployment from local machine for development purpose. Or commit the code change, and push to remote. Trigger the new created workflow to provision Amplify app for the project in AWS.

See [Deployment Documentation](./docs/Deployment.md) for the detailed information.
